# Migration to chart v0.1.2
The breaking change with chart 0.1.2 requires a full backup and restore of Consul as the chart will destroy all existing components and recreate them with new names.  Below are the steps to backup and restore Consul after the upgrade.

1. Execute into one of your Consul pods (using pod name `vault-prod-vault-consul-0` in this example).
```
kubectl exec -it vault-prod-vault-consul-0 sh
```
2. Create a Consul snapshot (replacing `dc1` with your datacenter name, if different)
```
consul snapshot save -client-cert /consul/tls/tls.crt -client-key /consul/tls/tls.key -ca-file /consul/ca/ca.crt.pem -http-addr https://localhost:8500 -tls-server-name server.dc1.consul migration.snapshot
```
3. Exit out of the pod and from your local machine, copy the snapshot out (change the name of the pod, if different)
```
kubectl cp vault-prod-vault-consul-0:migration.snapshot ./
```
4. Delete your Helm release and do a fresh installation with the new chart (this will obviously cause downtime).  The Vault pods will not become ready since you're starting with an empty Consul cluster but the restore will take care of that and you'll just need to unseal it again.
5. Copy the snapshot file into a Consul pod again (note the Consul pod names will have changed)
```
kubectl cp migration.snapshot vault-prod-consul-0:/migration.snapshot
```
6. Execute into that pod
```
kubectl exec -it vault-prod-consul-0 sh
```
7. Restore the snapshot
```
consul snapshot restore -client-cert /consul/tls/tls.crt -client-key /consul/tls/tls.key -ca-file /consul/ca/ca.crt.pem -http-addr https://localhost:8500 -tls-server-name server.dc1.consul /migration.snapshot
```
8.  At this point the data will be restored and you can unseal your vault and be up and running.

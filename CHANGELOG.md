### Action Required (Breaking Change)

* ACTION REQUIRED: This release contains a major change that standardizes and shortens the naming/labeling conventions of resources created with this Helm chart ([see #40](https://github.com/ReadyTalk/vault-helm-chart/issues/40)). As a result, in-place upgrades from chart v0.1.0 or v0.1.1 by simply doing a `helm upgrade` will result is many breaking issues. It may be possible to upgrade with a complex set of steps but the recommendation is that you backup your Consul cluster and do a fresh `helm install` with the new chart.  Then you can restore your data with a `consul snapshot restore`.  See the [0.1.2 migration guide](docs/0.1.2-MIGRATION.md) for a full set of steps.
